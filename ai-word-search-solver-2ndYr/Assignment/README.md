# AI Word Search Puzzle Solver

This was part of my coursework for the module Data Driven Computing, in the first semester of my second year. To run the programme, Python must be installed, from there you run:

```...\Assignment> python .\evaluate.py --display```

This will show you the results of the search for first the high quality data and then the low quality data, once the first window is closed. Percentage scores for the image-classification model can be found in the terminal.
