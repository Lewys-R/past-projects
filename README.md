# Past Projects Repository
A collection of code of different languages, culminated from coursework, extracurricular projects, et cetera from over the years. This is a public repository for anyone to observe the progressive development of my development skills.

Each root folder represents a different project and has been supplied with either the year of my course of which the project in question was completed, or the approximate calendar year the project was finalised.
